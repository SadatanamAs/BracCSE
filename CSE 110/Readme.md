## 🎯 Course Objectives

This course introduces students to the basics of programming using Java. It emphasizes problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and structured programming. By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand basic programming constructs: variables, data types, and operators.
- Implement control structures such as conditional statements and loops.
- Work with arrays and strings for data manipulation.
- Develop methods for code modularization.
- Understand basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: classes and objects.
- Perform basic file input/output operations.
- Debug and test Java programs.
